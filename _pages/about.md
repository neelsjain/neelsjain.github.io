Neel Jain is a 5th year [Computer Science PhD canditate](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/njain17) at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), working on all things LLM-related under the guidance of [Professor Tom Goldstein's](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) Lab. The majority of his work focuses on Safe and Trustworthy Machine Learning and holds multiple publications at top-conferences such as ICLR, Neurips, and COLM with over 2k citations. Neel earned his Masters in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park in 2023. **He is actively seeking industry positions this academic year.**

The widespread adoption of LLMs in everyday life highlights the pressing need to ensure these systems are both safe and trustworthy.
Thus, Neel's research focuses on Safe and Trustworthy Machine Learning, where he explore deeply interconnected challenges spanning refusal behavior, safety, evaluations, and reasoning. Through his [reserach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nSn7jtIAAAAJ) which has been published at leading ML conferences, Neel's strives to advance machine learning systems that reliably align with human intentions and contribute positively to society.
<!-- Evaluations guide progress by highlighting strengths and weaknesses. However, without advancing core capabilities, such as better data curation and enhanced training methods, the impact of these new evaluations is limited. Similarly, understanding how models generate copyrighted or harmful outputs is critical to addressing the limitations of current training techniques and for developing better approaches to mitigate these issues. -->
<!-- By tackling these challenges in unison, I aim to build AI systems that are not only powerful but also safe and trustworthy. -->

Prior to UMD, Neel graduated from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) in 2019 with Honors in Mathematics. At Williams, he wrote his thesis on graph theory under [Professor Pamela Harris](https://www.pamelaeharris.com/), which led to a publication in Graphs and Combinatorics. After Williams, Neel worked as a Data Scientist for [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/), where he worked on projects of various topics including math modeling and machine learning. 

In my spare time, he enjoys hiking in national parks, playing sports such as tennis, soccer, and squash, and board games like chess and catan.
