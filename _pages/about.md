I am a 4th year [Computer Science PhD student](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/njain17) at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), working on Safe and Trustworthy Machine Learning, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in [Professor Tom Goldstein's](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) Lab. I earned my Masters in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park in 2023. I have multiple publications at top-conferences such as ICLR, Neurips, and COLM. 

The widespread adoption of LLMs in everyday life, including their impact on my own parents, underscores the critical importance of ensuring these powerful systems are safe and trustworthy.
Safe and Trustworthy Machine Learning presents a broad range of deeply interconnected challenges, many of which I have explored in my [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nSn7jtIAAAAJ) and published at top conferences such as Neurips and ICLR. Evaluations guide progress by highlighting strengths and weaknesses. However, without advancing core capabilities, such as better data curation and enhanced training methods, the impact of these new evaluations is limited. Similarly, understanding how models generate copyrighted or harmful outputs is critical to addressing the limitations of current training techniques and for developing better approaches to mitigate these issues. By tackling these challenges in unison, I aim to build AI systems that are not only powerful but also safe and trustworthy.

Prior to UMD, I graduated from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) in 2019 with Honors in Mathematics. At Williams, I wrote my thesis on graph theory under [Professor Pamela Harris](https://www.pamelaeharris.com/), which led to a publication in Graphs and Combinatorics. After Williams, I worked as a Data Scientist for [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/), where I worked on projects of various topics including math modeling and machine learning. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking in national parks, playing sports such as soccer and squash, and board games like chess and catan.
